The template editor widget implements conditional rendering of messages depending on provided variables.
- Use conditional blocks to determine what text is going to be shown in the final message when 'if' statement returns something rather than null. 
- Define variables in the preview window to incert values in the message and change the text.
Code can be adjusted to take any list of valiables to use in the message.
